# spacetime-pixel

A collaborative project bootstrapped with a clean GitHub Flow + Conventional Commits workflow.

## Workflow
- Branch from `main`: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`
- Open Pull Request for every change
- At least 1 review before merge

## Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits, e.g.:
- `feat(core): add initial engine loop`
- `fix(ui): correct layout jitter on mobile`
- `docs: add contribution guide`
